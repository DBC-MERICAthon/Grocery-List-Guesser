"Replenish" - DBC June/July 2015 Hackathon

Replenish is a smart grocery list that pre-populates with suggested items based on average buying frequency. We built this Ruby on Rails app over the course of two days during the DevBootcamp Hackathon.

We in addition to Ruby on Rails we utilized Firebase w/Google OAuth for authenticaiton, a PostgreSQL database, and Javascript on the frontend complemented with jQuery, jBuilder, and AJAX.


Current state of development:
* A user can create a grocery list
* A user can see item predictions automatically appear in the lest
* A user can add and remove items from the list
* A user can mark items as purchased

Future features not yet implemented:
* A user can link recipe requirements to add appropriate ingredients and quanities to their list
* A user can link their list to populate an Amazon Fresh order
